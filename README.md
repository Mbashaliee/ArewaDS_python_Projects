## **AREWA DATA SCIENCE PYTHON PROGRAMMING PROJECTS**

_This very project was given by Arewa Data Science Academy Mentorship team after the the first phase of the mentorship program (Python programming fellowship) to test those who are qualified to go on to the next phase of the mentorship and to test our level of understanding._

# CONTENTS

**1. **Generating Data**** : In this project I worked on generating and visualizing data using various Python libraries such as Pandas and matplotlib to visulize the bar chart of a naira training set data of number of samples against naira domination which ranges from all reespective naira note 5 to 1000 naira.
